## Introduction
In the annals of medical history, few stories rival the groundbreaking work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818. Dr. Semmelweis, while active at the Vienna General Hospital during the mid-19th century, made a pivotal discovery that revolutionized the practice of medicine: the significance of handwashing in preventing infectious diseases, notably childbed fever. 🌟

## The Problem 🚨
Dr. Semmelweis's concern stemmed from a disturbing trend observed in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital. A staggering 10% of women giving birth were succumbing to childbed fever, a perilous affliction. With meticulous observation, Dr. Semmelweis traced the source of the epidemic to the contaminated hands of doctors attending to childbirth. 🤚

## The Solution 🛁
Despite his relentless efforts to persuade his colleagues to adopt handwashing practices, Dr. Semmelweis faced considerable resistance. However, undeterred by skepticism, he persisted in his advocacy for hygiene protocols. Eventually, the implementation of handwashing dramatically reduced mortality rates, validating Dr. Semmelweis's revolutionary hypothesis. 🏥

## Objective 🎯
This project embarks on a journey to revisit the seminal data that catalyzed Dr. Semmelweis's paradigm-shifting revelation regarding handwashing's pivotal role in healthcare. 📈

## Data Insights 📊
The dataset utilized in this analysis comprises historical records meticulously maintained by Dr. Semmelweis during his tenure at the Vienna General Hospital. These invaluable records document the incidence of childbed fever before and after the adoption of handwashing practices. 📜

## Methodology 🧪
Through meticulous examination of mortality rates among women giving birth, we seek to ascertain the tangible impact of handwashing interventions introduced by Dr. Semmelweis. By juxtaposing pre- and post-implementation data, we aim to unravel the transformative effects of hygiene protocols on public health outcomes. 📉
